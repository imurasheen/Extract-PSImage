# Extract-PSImage
A tool to extract Powershell script from PNG image generated by Invoke-PSImage.  

## Description
Extract a PowerShell script in the PNG file generated by **Invoke-PSImage**.  

About *Invoke-PSImage*, please see [here](https://github.com/peewpw/Invoke-PSImage). ã€€

Extract-PSImage is a PowerShell script.   
You should specify two params : The path to the PNG image, and the path to the file to output the extracted Powershell script.  

Extract-PSImage extracts the Powershell script string of the maximum length that the image file may contain.  
So there is a limitation.  
->If the embedded script is shorter than the maximum length, a random padding string is extracted after the script.

## Arguments
-Image [filepath] The path to the PNG image which you want to analyze.

-Out [filepath] The file to save the extracted Powershell script ( to the .ps1 file).

## Usage
PS> Import-Module .\Extract-Invoke-PSImage.ps1  
PS> Extract-Invoke-PSImage -Image [path to the PNG image] -Out [path to the .ps1 file]  
[Oneliner to extract embedded payload]  
[First 50 characters of extracted payload]  

## Example
Under the sample folder, I prepared two examples.


## Issue
1. Add the argument : -Length  
To specify the length to extract the Powershell script.
